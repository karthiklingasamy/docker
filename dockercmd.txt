what is containers Containers?

Containers are completely isolated environment. They have their own 
 1. Processes/services
 2. Network
 3. Mounts

Running instance of image



> docker version
> docker run nginx
> docker ps (list container)
> docker ps -a 
> docker stop <container Name>/<container ID>
> docker rm <container Name>/<container ID> (To remove the unwanted container to gain space)
> docker images (list images)
> docker rmi nginx (remove image. use must stop all the dependent container before remove images)
> docker pull nginx (Only pull the image and not run the conatiner)

Unlike Virtual machines containers are not ment to host virtual system. Containers are ment to run specific task or process
such to host the instance of the application server or database or some kind on computation or analysis task. Once the task is 
completed the container exits. Container only live as long as the process inside it alive. For example the web server inside the
container crashed the container will exits. Thats the reasion when you run a container on ubuntu exits immediatly. Bcz there is no
process running on ubuntu. If you really want to run ubuntu for a while run the below command

> docker run ubuntu sleep 5

Exec - execute a command
------------------------
> docker exec run <containetname>/<containerid> cat /etc/hosts (attach mode)

Run - attach and detach
---------------------------
> docker run kodelloud/simple-wenapp
It is running the container on attached mode or fourground. Meaning you will attached to the console or the standard output of the docker container
and you will see the output of the web services screen. you wont be able to do anything on this console untill the docket container stops.
It wont respon to you inputs. Press CTRL + C to stop the container and the application hosted on the container exits and get back to your prompt

> docker run -d <containetname>/<containerid> cat /etc/hosts (detach mode)

Now as soon as you execute the above command you will get the prompt immedialty. The container will continue to run in the background

> docker attach a043d (if you want to attach back to the running container later run this command)
